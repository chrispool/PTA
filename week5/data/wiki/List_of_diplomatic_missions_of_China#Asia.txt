For over fifty years the PRC has been competing with the Republic of China for diplomatic recognition in the international community. Until the 1970s, most countries in the world recognised the Republic of China instead of the People's Republic of China. As of 2008, a small number of states have full diplomatic relations with the ROC (see Republic of China diplomatic missions); the ROC maintains unofficial relations with most states.
There are a total of 370 diplomatic missions of the People's Republic of China across 170 countries worldwide.
